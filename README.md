# dayz-config-examples

DayZ configuration examples are few and far between which makes learning a nightmare, I speak from experience. This project looks to do the following;

(1) Provide examples of DayZ server configuration files which differ from the originals.
(2) Provide links to resources to help people configure server configuration files easier.

If you, like me, have found it difficult to find the information you need, feel free to get involved.

ToDo;

(1) Create a directory structure to place files in so configuration files that work together are grouped together.
(2) Create a readme in each directory with an explanation of how files link together and where their directory path locations on the server. As well as resources for easier configuration.
